This project is the digital emulation of the relationships among urban development pattern, regional surface energy balance and wildlife habitats. The lands are categorized by different landuse and represented as cell of different colors on 2D matrix - grey cell is the urban land, green cell is the wild land, and brown cell is the decayed wild land. Land surface attributes albedo, bowen ratio are programmed in land objects via Object-oriented programming and the system surface energy balance - regional temperature calturation- is implement via Net Radiation Equation in Agent-based Modeling.  The wildlife are abstracted as the shape of particles. Attributes as shape, size, age, gender, energy storage and behabiors as move, eat, reproduce, die are programmed into wildlife object via OOP. System rules (chapter 2.4) as predator-prey population change, the negative feedback relationship between nature land decay and glocal climate change (temperature change), the feedback loop between wildlife population and urban growth patten etc are emulated in the ABM process.
